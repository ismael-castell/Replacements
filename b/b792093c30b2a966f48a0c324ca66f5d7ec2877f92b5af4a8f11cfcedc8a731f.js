Usage...

This is the same type of code used by cell phones when you enter
a phone number into your dialer app.  Your phone already knows
what country you are a subscriber in, so it assumes you are entering
a local number, unless of course you prefix the number with a +, or
in the USA you could also prefix the number with 011 to indicate you
wish to dial internationally.  This code functions the same way.

Lets assume your in the United States and you enter the following
phone number: 8646978257

formatE164("US", "8646978257");
 Returns: +18646978257

countryForE164Number("US", "+18646978257");
 Returns: US

formatInternational("US", "8646978257");
 Returns: (864) 697-8257
 Info: This is the format you use if you are displaying this number to users outside the US
 
formatLocal("US", "8646978257");
 Returns: (864) 697-8257
 Info: This is the format you use if you are displaying this number to users inside the US
       (In certain countries, this format will be different then the international format)
 
countryCodeToName("US");
 Returns: United States
