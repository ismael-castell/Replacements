// DO NOT EDIT THIS GENERATED OUTPUT DIRECTLY!
// This file should be overwritten as part of your build process.
// If you need to extend the behavior of the generated service worker, the best approach is to write
// additional code and include it using the importScripts option:
//   https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#importscripts-arraystring
//
// Alternatively, it's possible to make changes to the underlying template file and then use that as the
// new base for generating output, via the templateFilePath option:
//   https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#templatefilepath-string
//
// If you go that route, make sure that whenever you update your sw-precache dependency, you reconcile any
// changes made to this original template file with your modified copy.

// This generated service worker JavaScript will precache your site's resources.
// The code needs to be saved in a .js file at the top-level of your site, and registered
// from your pages in order to be used. See
// https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-precache/blob/master/demo/app/js/service-worker-registration.js
// for an example of how you can register this script and handle various service worker events.
