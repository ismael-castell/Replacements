Having a more technical background than the typical marketer, Sean began to envision how modern quantitative tools could form the foundation of a 21st-century agency.","Bliss Point began in earnest in 2014 when Sean began collaborating intensively with co-founder Justin Manus (CTO) and Dr Anand Bodapati (Chief Scientist) to develop the core technology that would underpin the realization of this vision.
